Disarm
===========

A _very_ simple mod to bring back GTA IV's disarming gameplay. Simply shoot at
a ped's weapon, right hand, or right arm and the weapon drops.

## Building
You'll need [Script Hook V SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/). Clone
this in the folder where you extracted the contents to ScriptHookV_SDK.
